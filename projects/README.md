I tested the following steps on my linux machine with Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS.To get started, first install conda to your system, link is  [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Each project includes its own "environment.yml" file to get you started(except image restoration project, run it on Google Colab). Just enter the project folder and type the following from your terminal(or anaconda browser)

>> conda env create -f environment.yml


>> conda activate [env_name]


>> jupyter lab or jupyter notebook
